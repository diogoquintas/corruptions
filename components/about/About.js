        <dt>What's is corruptions?</dt>
        <dd>
          At the base level, corruptions is an NFT collection, it can be traded
          like any other NFT, it has artworks and it has properties. It started
          with 4196 corruptions, each one having unique visual features. At the
          moment, some of those corruptions evolved or "deviated" to other
          forms. Even though some mechanics related to the collection are a
          breakthrough in the NFT space that does not cover half of what is
          happening in the project, at the root of it, there's something
          different.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          What's different here? What's going on beyond the marketplace
          collection?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          There are some unique features in this collection that have never
          happened before. This all started with the creator, Dom Hofmann,
          deploying a{" "}
          <abbr title="Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.">
            contract on Ethereum
          </abbr>
          . Followers of Dom, noticed the contract and rushed to{" "}
          <abbr title="Bring an NFT to life.">mint</abbr> the corruptions. The
          artworks were cryptic looking and had a weird mechanic called
          "insight" which would grow in time, decreasing in aceleration if the
          corruption was transferred ownership. From then on, other contracts
          were deployed by Dom, one in particular called{" "}

          </Link>
          . During this, the creator never explained or promoted the project
          publicly, so, the role to understand and figure out what each contract
          did was delegated to the community. A group of like-minded people
          interested in the project created a{" "}
