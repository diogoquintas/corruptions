          What's <em>corruptions</em>?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          At the base level, <em>corruptions</em> is an NFT collection, it can
          be traded like any other NFT, it has artworks and it has properties.
          It started with 4196 corruptions, each one having unique visual
          features. At the moment, some of those corruptions evolved or
          "deviated" to other forms. Even though some mechanics related to the
          collection are a breakthrough in the NFT space that does not cover
          half of what is happening in the project, at the root of it, there's
          something different.

          What's different here? What's going on beyond the marketplace
          collection?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          There are some unique features in this collection that have never
          happened before. This all started with the creator, Dom Hofmann,
          deploying a{" "}
          <abbr title="Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.">
            contract on Ethereum
          </abbr>
          . Followers of Dom, noticed the contract and rushed to{" "}
          <abbr title="Bring an NFT to life.">mint</abbr> the corruptions. The
          artworks were cryptic looking and had a misterious mechanic called
          "insight" which appeared to be growing overtime with an acceleration
          that would decrease if the corruption was transfered. From then on,
          other contracts were deployed by Dom, one in particular called{" "}

          . All of this was happening without any explanation from Dom, only
          code. The people trying to figure out what was going on created a{" "}
